    container_name: bitpingd-cli
    restart: "no" # CLI used for authentication only
    entrypoint: /app/bitpingd

    container_name: bitpingd-node
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      - bitpingd-cli
    volumes:
      - ./bitpingd-volume:/root/.bitpingd

  bitpingd-env:

```yaml
docker compose up -d
```

### CLI
Using environment variable or Dotenv `.env` defined e.g.
```sh
docker run -it --mount type=volume,source="bitpingd-volume",target=/root/.bitpingd --entrypoint /app/bitpingd bitping/bitpingd:latest login --email "YOUR_BITPING_EMAIL" --password "YOUR_BITPING_PASSWORD"
```
Option 1. To run the container in interactive mode:
```sh
bash docker run -it --mount type=volume,source="bitpingd-volume",target=/root/.bitpingd bitping/bitpingd:latest
```

Option 2. To run the container and pass email and password via CLI instead of an interactive session run:
Log in to your account with the following command:
```sh
docker run -it --mount type=volume,source="bitpingd-volume",target=/root/.bitpingd --entrypoint /app/bitpingd bitping/bitpingd:latest login --email "YOUR_BITPING_EMAIL" --password "YOUR_BITPING_PASSWORD"
```
Now start the bitping node!
```sh
docker run -it --mount type=volume,source="bitpingd-volume",target=/root/.bitpingd bitping/bitpingd:latest
```

Option 3. Login with environment variables:
```sh
docker run -it \
  -e BITPING_EMAIL='YOUR_BITPING_EMAIL' \
  -e BITPING_PASSWORD='YOUR_BITPING_PASSWORD' \
  -e BITPING_MFA='YOUR_BITPING_2FA_CODE' \
  --mount type=volume,source="bitpingd-volume",target=/root/.bitpingd bitping/bitpingd:latest
```
